		Hello World!
		
		<h7>My name is Kerwin</h7>
		<h5>Games and Doggos!!<h5>
		<p>So yeah doggos and game are my thing but only competitive games though. if I'm not putting my "skills" to the test in video games then what's the point ya know.
		Now when it comes to doggos my all time favorite breeds are British Bulldogs, Shiba Izus, and Alaskan Huskies. I also had a small doggo a year ago named Princess but she passed (I know much sad) but such is life and recently I've adopted a new pupper named Zeus who just so happens to be a British Bulldogs.
